Design Notes

I've added a 'Card Details' title for the card form for consistency with the titles added for the Billing and shipping addressses.

I've change the labels and 'Change' links for the addresses to sentence case for greater legibility.

I have used 2 selects for the Card Expiry Date, with the number formatting consistent with that of credit/debit cards. The Card Start Date would follow this pattern, but since it is never needed, I have removed the option.

I've removed the blue '?' info button for the CCV field, I've added the help information next to the field.

The 'Amount to Pay' field is disabled -you don't want user changing the total, I have slightly greyed this out to indicate this.

I've added some affordance on the 'Pay Now' button. I have also removed the 'Cancel' button, i counldn't thibnk of a reason why this action would be needed.

From yesterday meeting.
Regarding the worst food I have tasted, I once had Crystallised Ginger, it was truly the most disgusting food I have ever tasted.
